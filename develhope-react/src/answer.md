In a React application, there are different ways to access the current value of the username and password inputs in a form, depending on whether you're using controlled components or uncontrolled components.

Controlled Components:
State Variables: If you're using controlled components (where input values are controlled by React state), you can access the current values of the inputs by retrieving the values from the respective state variables.

Uncontrolled Components:
Refs: In uncontrolled components, where you're not managing input values via React state, you can use refs to access the current values of the inputs.
Event Handling (On Submit): When handling form submission, you can access the input values directly within the submit event handler by accessing the form elements.
